    Thanks for stopping by! A bit about me, and why I started this blog: Like many developers,
    I started building websites by Googling for whatever I wanted to do. This worked really well
    and was sufficient for almost everything I did when I began making websites in high school
    and still works for almost everything that I want to do today. Eventually, though, one makes
    the leap from copying others to synthesizing
